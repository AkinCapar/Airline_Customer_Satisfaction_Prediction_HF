## About Dataset

The dataset offers valuable insights into customer satisfaction within an unnamed airline. Although the airline’s identity remains confidential, the dataset is extensive, comprising 22 columns and 129,880 records. Its primary goal is to predict whether future passengers will be satisfied based on multiple influencing factors.

These factors likely include elements such as flight punctuality, service quality, and other key aspects affecting the travel experience. Through analysis of this data, the airline can better understand what drives customer satisfaction and adjust its services to improve overall passenger experience.
